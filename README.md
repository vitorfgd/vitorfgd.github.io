I built my design portfolio with HTML/Swig/YAML, JavaScript/jQuery, Sass, and Gulp. If you're a designer
and that's up your alley, you can use this as a starting point for your own portfolio.

### Instructions

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Install Gulp and the other Node packages. This may take a while:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the app:

    ```
    gulp serve
    ```

4. Edit the [data](https://github.com/romannurik/portfolio/tree/master/app/data) and
   [media](https://github.com/romannurik/portfolio/tree/master/app/media) files. Your
   changes should show up on in the browser immediately while `gulp serve` is still
   running.

5. When you're done, generate the minified HTML/JavaScript/CSS/media files:

    ```
    gulp
    ```
